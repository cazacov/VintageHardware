Olivetti M24 / AT&T 6300 Keyboard Emulator
v.1.00
Copyirght (C) Valerio 2018

This emulator is for use with an Arduino Nano / Uno (Atmel ATmega328p)
to convert scan codes from an AT/PS/2 keyboard using scan code set 2
to scan codes that would be generated by the original keyboard
of an Olivetti M24 / AT&T PC 6300. Specifically, the keyboard being 
emulated is a either an 83-key "Keybaord 1" keyboard (default) or a 
103-key, "Keyboard 2" type (or "deluxe" type) keyboard, both with
a US key layout. RightCTRL+1 or 2 switches between the two.

This software requires external hardware to pull down the DATA line of
the M24 keyboard interface, as well as the DATA and CLOCK lines of the 
PS/2 interface. All testing was done using a 74LS07 for this purpose, 
although other solutions could work (such as discrete transistors).
